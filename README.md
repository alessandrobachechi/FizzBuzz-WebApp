# FizzBuzz

## Description

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem often used in coding interviews. This project is a JavaScript implementation of the FizzBuzz game, designed to test basic programming skills.

## Features

- **Simple Game Logic**: The game prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- **Versatile Implementation**: This project can be easily adapted for different programming languages, making it a great tool for learning and practicing coding in various environments.
- **Educational Value**: FizzBuzz is a common interview question that helps assess a candidate's basic programming skills, including loops, conditionals, and basic I/O operations.

## Installation
